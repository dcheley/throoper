The Injustice 2 Pro series is winding down before the 2017 World Championships. With only a few events remaining before the World Championship each of these events each tournament is increasingly important as players have fewer remaining chances to qualify.

August was an action packed month for the Injustice 2 Pro Series with 3 major tournaments being held and action on both sides of the Atlantic.

The Summer Jam in Philadelphia was the first of these three events to get underway, and familiar faces rose to the top. SonicFox again found himself in the Winner’s bracket finals but was taken down by Semiij from Noble. Despite the setback he worked himself back to the finals using RedHood before again trying his luck with Captain Cold against Semiij. This time he was able to emerge victorious however and once again was crowned a champion. The EVO 2017 champion, Noble Dragon, finished in 5th after being defeated by his own teammate iLuusions.

Across the Atlantic in Birmingham, UK VS Fighting was taking place the same weekend. Through all of the fighting one man emerged unscathed, never suffering a series defeat. Biohazard was able to walk through the competition using Harley Quinn and Bane, only being brought to a game 5 in a single series. RNG’s Whiteboi, the CEO 2017 winner, finished in fourth continuing to use both Scarecrow and Aquaman.

The month concluded at Absolute Battle in Dallas Texas with SonicFox again cementing his dominance on the North American circuit. Dragon finished in 3rd and Biohazard finished 4th, proving their performances this season have not been flukes and foreshadowing potential matchups of interest at the World Championships.

The final 3 events of the pro series take place September 2nd and 3rd with the finals being held on the 17th. All of the action can be watched live on the official Injustice 2 Twitch channel.
