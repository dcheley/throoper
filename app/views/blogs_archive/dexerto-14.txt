According to the first broadcast of the Summer 2017 European Halo Championship Series Pro League, the top four HCS European pro teams will be given championship bracket spots at the upcoming Dreamhack Atlanta event.

These teams will receive these spots in lieu of having their own LAN final.

The announcement definitely came as a surprise, with one quarter of the Championship Bracket previously expected to go to NA teams, now being filled with European pro players.

Some community members believe the change in format will harm North American AM scene, as amateurs go to open tournaments to try and qualify for those Championship Bracket spots and now have four fewer spots to compete for.

Anything affecting turnout is definitely important, as this has been an issue for a title that has had trouble selling out events and reaching the historic participation levels of the past.

Obviously, European players and fans will be excited about the news, but some North Americans have argued that top EU teams are often far better than amateur NA ones.

While the top European teams are definitely capable of playing at the highest levels, is it worth discouraging amateur players from attending and competing at one of the biggest LAN events of the season? Or is gathering the best players around the world worth it regardless of the cost to the amateur scene? Let us know what you think in our poll!
