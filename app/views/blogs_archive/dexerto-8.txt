Another week of HCS action has come to a close, leaving only a single week of regular season play to be completed. OpTic has performed as expected, but some of the other top teams have had some surprises for us.

Splyce Take Down EnVyUs â€“ Secures Top 2

Splyce showed the world on Thursday that they are the real deal. Defeating Team Liquid earlier in the season had people wondering just how good this Splyce lineup could be, and their victory over EnVyUs last night continued that discussion.

The series was a back and forth affair with Team EnVyUs securing wins in games 1 and 3, before Splyce rebound in games 2 and 4 to force a deciding game 5. Every time Splyce had their backs to the wall they responded and showed the mental makeup of a championship caliber team.

Game 5 was reminiscent of the series, with only a handful of kills separating the teams at any given point. In the end, Splyce was able to secure the victory ensuring they alone get to battle it out with OpTic Gaming in the final week for the top seed.

The stage is set for an incredible showdown in the final week of regular season play.

Roster Mayhem

The final two series of the day involved teams that have made roster swaps in the past week in order to shake things up. For one team this seemed to work wonders, the others have struggle to find their footing.

Str8 Rippin has had multiple roster issues, with Ace being traded for Rayne and APG trying out for Luminosity Gaming.

Str8 Rippin found themselves matched up against an EG roster this week that has been steadily improving, easily dismantling a hapless Str8 3-0.

The result leaves Str8 adrift at the bottom of the standings with 0 wins on the season. They will now almost certainly have to play through the Open Bracket in Atlanta to avoid relegation.

While Str8 has struggle to adjust to their new roster change, Team Liquidâ€™s trade has given them new life. After a strong performance on Thursday, Liquid came out against a Ronin Esports squad that was desperately searching for another victory.

Liquid was too much for them to handle however, and Ronin was dismissed with a quick 3-0.

While the top and bottom of the rankings are already well defined, the middle of the pack is still very tightly grouped, providing us with plenty of important series heading into the final week of play.

Everyone will be fighting to have a guaranteed slot in the Championship Bracket at Dreamhack and for the teams who fail, the open bracket awaits with the threat of Relegation looming.
