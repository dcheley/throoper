Oxygen Supremacy has continued to prove they are the best Amateur squad in Halo with back to back wins during the opening two HCS Summer 2017  Legendary Cups.

The roster consisting of Kyle ‘Nemassist’ Kubina, Ryan ‘Ryanoob’ Geddes, Troy ‘DasTroyed’ Dusman, and Cody ‘ContrA’ Szczodrowski earned themselves yet another $1,000 on Sunday. While this time the competition was able to put up a better fight, the end result was the same.

This time around Oxygen Supremacy encountered ABCDE in the Winners Finals and Grand Finals. The ABCDE squad lead by Gilbert ‘Munoz’ Munoz was no match for the veteran roster of Oxygen Supremacy,being defeated 3-2 and 4-2 in the two final series.

Incendiary was able to secure themselves the third place finish and the final cash prize for the day. Wise Gaming, the runner’s up from the initial legendary cup, were notably not present.

The next Legendary Cup will take place Sunday June 12th and Oxygen Supremacy will certainly be looking to win their third in a row.
