The fourth major stop of the CWL took place June 16th-18th with all of the best teams in the world in attendance this weekend in Anaheim, California. The weekend was a typical MLG event, with a packed venue and excited fans and spectators ready to watch the best teams in the world compete.


Walking away with the victory was an unexpected Luminosity Gaming. This was the first time this roster ever made it to the finals on LAN, and they were able to secure themselves their first CWL tournament victory.


Luminosity was placed into Pool B for the pool play portion of the tournament and emerged from their pool in a tie for first place with European Epsilon Esports. OpTic emerged from Pool D undefeated, and Eunited only lost to OpTic in pool play. This made many believe that the rest of the tournament would also just be business as usual.


Luminosity had different plans however. Matching up against OpTic in the first round of the championship bracket, Luminosity was able to pull off the upset and secure a 3-2 series victory to send OpTic to the loser’s bracket.


Despite this being the first series of the championship bracket, it was the most difficult test Luminosity faced. They didn’t drop another map until the Grand Finals, where they were able to defeat Splyce in a convincing 3-1 fashion. OpTic was forced to make a run through the loser’s bracket but fell short in a series against Enigma6.
 

The tournament MVP was Sam ‘Octane’ Larew from Luminosity Gaming, who’s individual performance played a significant part in Luminosity’s first tournament victory.


The next major CoD event will take place in Columbus, Ohio from June 30th – July 23rd as the second stage of pro league will begin, full information on that event can be found here.
